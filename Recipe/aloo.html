    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare the Dough: Mix whole wheat flour with a pinch of salt and enough water to form a smooth dough. Let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Filling: Combine mashed potatoes with cumin seeds, coriander powder, red chili powder, garam masala, chopped cilantro, and salt.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Paranthas: Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a small circle, place a spoonful of the potato filling in the center, and fold the edges to seal. Roll out the filled dough gently to form a paratha.</li>
            <li>Cook the Paranthas: Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook each paratha with a bit of ghee or oil until golden brown on both sides, pressing lightly to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Serve Hot: Enjoy with yogurt, pickles, or chutney.</li>
